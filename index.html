    <h2 id="aboutme">About Me</h2>
        <p>My birthday is November 1st 2000, I was born in Fresno. My hobbies 
        are music, dancing. I have five brothers and no sisters, my dream 
        vacation is to go Paris and go back to Disneyland. I want to live In 
        Los Angles when I grow up or Las Vegas. And my dream job is to be a 
        hairstylist or a makeup artist.</p>

        <h3>Personal</h3>
        <p>My goal is to graduate and go to college, and become either a 
        hairstylist or a makeup artist. I was thinking being a hairstylist but 
        it was too hard I tried makeup tutorial but it was too hard, then I 
        started looking at makeup tutorials and it was easier for me, but I 
        might be a hairstylist when I grow up, It is either one but if I were 
        to pick my dream job I would want to be a hairstylist. So my goals are 
        to graduate finish college and either become a hairstylist or a makeup 
        artist.</p>
